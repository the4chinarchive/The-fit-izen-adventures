The south gate saw the least traffic of the three gates into the city, being closest to the coast and furthest from the main street, so usually only the old or the slow were sent to stand guard there.<br><br>One of the guards noticed a person approaching out of the corner of his eye, and looked up from the game he had entertained himself with. He flinched, rubbing his eyes before doing a double take. Coming up the seaside road was a man the size of an oxen, draped in a leather cloak covering his body from head to feet. His large beard was obscuring most of face, but clear, strong eyes were gazing sternly out from underneath his hood. He was holding a large, crude satchel along his body, almost dragging it along the dirt road.<br><br>\u201cHalt! Who goes there?\u201d the guardsman called out, instinctively moving his hand to the hilt of his sword. The large man did not break his stride, but instead raised a hand from the inside of his cloak. His bare, muscled arm was the size of a cart axle, and covered in scars.",

His beard shifted, indicating a slight smile, but his eyes remained steely. The guardsman eased up a bit.<br><br>\u201cWe will have to see some proof of identity. Do you have that on you?\u201d<br><br>\u201c...I do not,\u201d the man said, pausing for a bit before continuing, \u201cI have lost most of my belongings.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMugged, were you?

We will also need your name, age, and place of birth.\u201d<br><br>The large man reached into his satchel and took something out. He approached the guardsman, towering a good head and a half over him, and dropped something into his hands. The guardsman looked down upon a large, red, uncut gemstone.<br><br>\u201cMy name is Nathaniel Geinz. I am 18 years of age, and I am not sure where I was born.\u201d<br><br>-<br><br>The narrow streets of Ringstad were a sea of colorful awnings, storefronts, and stalls. Scores of people from all races were going about their business, buying, selling, traversing, or simply relaxing. Natty was towering above them, gazing down the street, trying to eye out a good place to sell the goods he\u2019d brought with him. He pulled back his hood, revealing a mane of thick, brown hair, tied back with a coarse thread. He felt eyes fall upon him from the shadows of the alleyways leading away from the street, but pushed their presence to the back of his mind. He hid his satchel under his cloak and started walking.<br><br>One set of eyes followed him more closely than the others. Natty felt someone slip up behind him, and tensed up as a muscular arm slipped over his shoulder.",

He was met with the cocky smile of an older man, scruffy stubble clinging to a cut jawline, with a short, slicked-back haircut complimenting his head. He was wearing a nice linen shirt with a v-cut, tight hoses, and leather shoes. His friendly eyes stared right in to the doubting glare of Natty.<br><br>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Natty prodded at him.<br><br>\u201cI just thought you could use a guide. You know, to show you the ropes of this town. You wouldn\u2019t want to get taken for a ride by scrupulous types, now would you?\u201d The man looked back over his shoulder and scanned the crowd, as to confirm that they weren\u2019t being followed.<br><br>\u201cIn my optics, that\u2019s exactly the kind of type you seem to be.\u201d Natty shot back.

What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br><br>The man flashed a confident grin.<br><br>\u201cMy name\u2019s Billy, but my friends call me Aniki.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWell Aniki,\u201d Natty said, \u201cyou can call me Natty.

Thief!!\u201d<br><br>They both turned their heads to see a fuzzy blur bolt right towards them. As it passed by, Natty\u2019s free hand shot out from underneath the cloak and grabbed hold of its tail. The young girl was abruptly yanked onto the ground by her own momentum, the satchel of loot she was carrying flying from her grasp.",

He carefully evaluated the gemstones that Natty brought, and gave him a fair price.

Have you ever seen a thing like this before?\u201d<br><br>Natty reached into his cloak and took out a huge medallion hanging from a leather string around his neck. It was a large, polished metal disc, cast from black iron, with a wide hole in the middle of it. It had a large groove running inside it, and inside that was inscribed \u201c1.25kg\u201d.<br><br>Gildroy looked at it curiously, studying it closely like a piece of rare art.<br><br>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have,\u201d he concluded after a while, \u201cbut if you will let me make a sketch of it, I will ask around among my fellow antiquarians.

Gildroy fetched parchment and a piece of charcoal from a desk drawer and made a couple of quick sketches of the medallion before returning the items to the table.<br><br>\u201cCheck back with me in a couple of days, I\u2019ll have some answers by then.\u201d He said. Natty thanked him, and with that, him and Aniki set out to find a tavern.

Aniki was making pleasant small-talk, but Natty couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that they were being followed. Stepping around a corner, they were suddenly confronted by two hooded figures who had been standing in wait for them.<br><br>Aniki stopped dead in his tracks and stared at them.

If you do not hand it over willingly, we will take it by force.\u201d<br><br>The three other figures reached into their cloaks and pulled out a long, curved dagger each. The figure that had spoken to Natty raised its head enough that its face was exposed. Thin, blueish skin clung onto a hairless skull, its eyes shining with a cold, icy glare.<br><br>\u201cUh, Natty, bro,\u201d Aniki started, his voice uncertain, \u201cyou might want to rethink your position.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo time to think. Back me up!\u201d Natty yelled, releasing the buckle on his cloak. It dropped to the ground, revealing a massive, chiseled body, covered in scars, with a huge set of claw marks running across his back. Apart from a fur loincloth, the only thing he was wearing were a pair of cord sandals, extending all the way up his ankle. In one swift motion, he squatted down as deep as he could, clenching both of his fists and locking them in for a double punch.<br><br>\u201c[Hip Drive]!\u201d",

The words from Aniki seemed to lift his spirit to a new level. Invigorated, he caught the dagger of one of the figures with his left hand, and smashed its face into a cobblestone wall with his right hand. The figure fell to the ground, immobile.<br><br>Directing his attention towards the last one, he discovered that he was already face-to-face with it.

His grandma had been clutching the medallion he was now wearing when he found her lifeless body. It had seemed like the goblins were trying to take it from her. When Natty had touched the plate, the memories of a lost life had flooded into his brain. The knowledge of a former existence, one in a very advanced, but lifeless, world, where he had spent his time honing his body. Knowledge of advanced training routines, arcane wisdom on food and nutrition, and the discipline to follow through with it all had etched itself into his soul, but in the process, an intolerable amount of pain and loneliness had torn him apart inside. The only thing he could do to not go insane was to flee into the mountains and forests, leaving behind the community he had grown up in.",
