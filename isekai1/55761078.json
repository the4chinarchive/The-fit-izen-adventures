This is the first chapter. Enjoy.<br><br>Chapter 1: Rebirth<br><br>Dark raindrops fell on the cold asphalt, illuminated by the headlights of the passing cars.<br><br>A lone, hulking figure, carrying a duffelbag, walked slowly through the rain, shoulder hunched to shelter against the cold of the night. He\u2019d just finished his daily workout at the 24-hour gym he was registered at, lifting alone in the middle of the night as usual. He liked the loneliness of an empty gym.<br><br>As the clock had gone past midnight, it was now his 30th birthday. According to several legends on the internet, he was now officially a Wizard, having never felt even the embrace of a woman apart from his mother in all of his life. Despite having the body of a marble statue carved to illustrate the perfect specimen, his lack of ambition in life, and perhaps lack of affection from anyone, had led his personality to become that of a hermit.<br><br>Perhaps it was the darkness of the night and the patter of rain, or perhaps it was him being lost in a world inside his head, that made him not notice the dairy truck that was driving at full speed towards him as he crossed the road to his apartment building. The result was the same, however, and the last thing he would see in this world was a rapidly approaching set of lights.<br><br>- <br><br>When he came to, he was in a sauna. Apart from a small towel draped across his nethers, he was naked, sweat already glistening off his muscles. Confusion struck, and his mind had to grasp for a few seconds with the new reality before he could properly focus. His eyes scanned the damp room and found a figure sitting at the other end of the sauna. Dark, tattooed skin stretched over a body of lean muscle, spiky dark hair on his head, and a sly smile on his face. The figure grinned.<br><br>\u201cLooks like ya finally made it, brah.\u201d",

Yer 6 feet unda, but this ain\u2019t the afterlife. Ya did it, ya sad cunt. Ya became a Wizard. And as a reward, ya get the chance for a do-over.\u201d<br><br>Zyzz stood up, sweat falling off his body.

Magic and swords and\u2026 what do you mean!?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s magic, brah. I ain\u2019t gotta explain shit.\u201d<br><br>And with that, Zyzz flexed his pecs, struck a pose, and winked at the man, who vanished into steamy mist.<br><br>-<br><br>A river curved its way through a valley of grassy hills and oak trees. Sparse farms and farmland were scattered here and there, and in the middle of the valley was a small hamlet built around an old stone bridge crossing the river. Sun was basking from a nearly cloudless sky, and birdsong was carried by the wind to the ears of the farmers toiling with sowing the fields. Spring was in the air.<br><br>At a small wooden hut near the edge of a forest, not too far from the small village, a young boy was chopping wood energetically. He was thin, of average height, with a fair complexion, light brown hair, and deep green eyes.<br><br>\u201cPhew,\u201d he exclaimed, putting down the hatchet. He walked over to the nearby well and procured a bucket of water that he drank from vigorously, making sure to spill at least half all over himself in the process. Finishing drinking, he spotted an old, gray-haired woman walking up the road towards the hut.",

Time passes so fast...\u201d<br><br>She ruffled Natty\u2019s hair one more time as they both went inside the hut to have lunch.<br><br>-<br><br>Days later, Natty found himself standing wearing his finest clothes in front of the village\u2019s chapel. It was old, cut from the same rough stone that was used for the village bridge, and green moss had grown on spots where the sun rarely fell. He scratched his neck, since the woolen vest he was wearing was itching something bad. He sighed and shrugged to himself, but then heard someone call his name from behind him.<br><br>\u201cHeeeey, Natty!\u201d<br><br>A young girl was running towards him. She was wearing a white linen dress and leather sandals, her suntan skin clashing with the pale cloth. Her dark, frizzy hair was tied up in a short ponytail with a blue ribbon, and her blue eyes were gleaming in the midday sun.<br><br>\u201cGlad I caught you before you went inside!\u201d she exclaimed joyfully as she stopped in front of him.",

Well, let\u2019s get inside and get this over with.\u201d<br><br>They both fixed their clothing a last time and headed to the entrance to the chapel.<br><br>-<br><br>The inside of the chapel was nice and cool. Aside from the main hall, there was a few antechambers, and doors leading to the priest\u2019s office and the stairs to the bell tower. The main room had a few rows of wooden benches facing the altar, and the altar itself was humble, with but a few holy relics placed upon a velvet cloth. Hanging over the altar was the Symbol of the Sun, a four-armed cross meant to represent the four elements of reality.<br><br>Sitting on the benches were the three other kids from the village who had turned 13 in the last year. Brom, the blacksmith\u2019s son, already stout for his age. Ragna, the daughter of a local farmer, a fair but meek girl. And Lenheit, the son of a poacher, pale and ghostly from learning his father\u2019s trade at night. The priest was standing facing the altar when Natty and Fayn entered, and turned around as he heard the door open.<br><br>\u201cAh, Nathaniel, Fayana, you\u2019re here. Good. Then we can get started.\u201d<br><br>He stroked his long, gray beard and adjusted the clerical gown on his head before picking up a decorated staff that was resting against the altar.",

He was no longer in the church, instead he found himself in a plane that seemed to be made of pure light, stretching far beyond what his eyes could see. From above, he could hear the faint sound of wings flapping, and as he looked up his eyes fell upon a figure descending slowly towards him.<br><br>There was something familiar about the angel that stood before him. Dark, tan, tattooed skin, spiky hair, and a smile like that of an old friend.

He waved goodbye to the men working with him at the lumber site, and started jogging back towards the village.",

It\u2019s the foundation of the physical magic that a [Muscle Wizard] specializes in.<br><br>Half a year had passed since the baptism ceremony and Natty\u2019s angelic vision. In that time, he had begun exploring the extends of his [Class], and had come upon the discovery of the [Pump] skill during a workout session. He was lost in thought about how to extend his magical capability during his jog home, when his nostrils picked up the scent of burnt wood. Coming over a hill, he saw the flicker of a fire lighting up the trees near the hut where he lived. A column of thick smoke rose up into the violet evening sky. Dark clouds were gathering beyond the eastern mountains. He froze, eyes wide in terror. His home was on fire.<br><br>He sprinted. The sun had barely made it beyond the horizon when he reached the grounds. Broken stoneware and splintered wood were spread chaotically around, illuminated by the tall flames emanating from the remains of the ransacked hut.<br><br>\u201cGrandma!?

He didn\u2019t even hear himself activate [Pump], and the next thing he knew, he was standing holding the upper half of a goblin skull in his hands, blood dripping onto the decapitated corpse by his feet, head torn off at the jaw. The two remaining goblins took a few steps back, then launched at him at the same time, teeth and claws extended, ready to flay him and drain his vitality from his body.<br><br>Natty launched the skull at one of the goblins with an underhand throw. It hit it square in the shoulder, disintegrating in the process, tearing the arm off the goblin and sending it spinning. The other goblin managed to close the distance, and dug its claws and teeth into the exposed back of Natty. He felt his legs give out under him as the goblin began stealing his life force. Quickly, he reached behind and grabbed the goblin by its leg, swinging it overhead and slamming it into the rocky soil, pulverizing every bone in its upper body. Regaining his composure, he walked over to the last goblin, which was pathetically trying to scurry away while clutching the wound of where its arm had used to be. Raising his leather boot above its head, Natty brought it down with ground-shaking force, splattering goblin brains across the dirt.<br><br>Natty fell to his knees, the effect of [Pump] leaving his body as the first drops of rain started to fall. He staggered his way over to his grandma. As he knelt in front of her body, an autumnal downpour began hammering the quiet valley, quickly extinguishing the fire and left the grounds covered in a dark, smoldering blanket of water and smog. Before the emergency dispatch from the village arrived on the scene, it was said that they could hear the lamenting cries of Natty from miles off, even through the heavy rain.<br><br>- - - - -<br><br>End of chapter 1.

      "com": "Ight, fella, I may be late to this thread, but here are some of my criticisms:<br><br>1. Ditch the opening bit, it really doesn&#039;t need to be there. Any exposition can be done by Zyzz in purgatory. Ambiguity will be a very nice tool for your protagonist&#039;s past, since they are starting anew.<br><br>2. Where&#039;s the conflict??? All this chapter does is give us some backstory and some context. Either double down on the wish fulfillment, or double down on the tragedy. Our protagonist currently has no motivation and no end goal.<br><br>I suggest this: First off, age him up to 15 so he can be considered a bit more of a man, 13 is still well in &quot;child&quot; territory. Second off, set up his relationships with everyone better. Let is see them together, let us see a little bit of who they are. Then, kill them all. ALL of them. Tomboy gf, grandma, best friend, dead. Tear his idyllic world from right in front of him. Lastly, have this lead directly into Natty&#039;s motivation, where he wants either revenge or justice for whomever or whatever killed his village.<br><br>3. Characterize your protagonist better. Many isekai fall into this trap, and I see this happening to yours. Give him a discrenible personality right off the bat, by showing it off as opposed to telling the audience about it. Even something akin to Jonathan Joestar would be better.<br><br>Other than that, I like the concept. Overall a pleasant read so far.<br><br>Some character concepts:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Big, buff Gigachad. Very handsome, always calm and smiling. Can be thick-skulled at times, has a hard time understanding subtext.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Party animal, a young man drunk on local fame and hoes. Cocky, overly confident, barely takes anything seriously. Highly luck-based strategies.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Young, bright-eyed, heart-of-the-group newbie who learns what it means to be a hero and ends up sacrificing himself, resulting in a soul-crushing scene.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A young woman healer. Generally cheerful, optimistic, and genuinely innocent, to be contrasted heavily with the villain&#039;s main henchwoman.</span>",

He was holding a large, crude satchel along his body, almost dragging it along the dirt road.<br><br>\u201cHalt!

Its just too obviously a /fit ref. Even something like obscuring the word a bit more would have helped, like &quot;Gheinz&quot; or &quot;Gaynes&quot;.

Here, follow me, we can take a shortcut through the back streets.\u201d<br>Natty followed Aniki through the narrow back alleys of Ringstad. Aniki was making pleasant small-talk, but Natty couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that they were being followed. Stepping around a corner, they were suddenly confronted by two hooded figures who had been standing in wait for them.<br><br>Aniki stopped dead in his tracks and stared at them.

If you do not hand it over willingly, we will take it by force.\u201d<br><br>The three other figures reached into their cloaks and pulled out a long, curved dagger each. The one pointing at Natty raised its head enough that its face was exposed. Thin, blueish skin clung onto a hairless skull, its eyes shining with a cold, icy glare.<br><br>\u201cUh, Natty, bro,\u201d Aniki started, his voice uncertain, \u201cyou might want to rethink your position.\u201d",

It dropped to the ground, revealing a massive, chiseled body, covered in scars, with a huge set of claw marks running across his back. Apart from a fur loincloth, the only thing he was wearing was a pair of cord sandals, extending all the way up his ankle. In one swift motion, he squatted down as deep as he could, clenching both of his fists and locking them in for a double punch.<br><br>\u201c[Hip Drive]!\u201d<br><br>In a split-second burst of explosiveness, Natty launched himself ahead and smashed both of the hooded figures who\u2019d cut off their back right in their abdomens.

The words from Aniki seemed to lift his spirit to a new level. Invigorated, he caught the dagger of one of the figures with his left hand, and smashed its face into a wall with his right hand. The figure fell to the ground, immobile.<br><br>Directing his attention towards the last one, he discovered that he was already face-to-face with it.

The figure let out a raspy laugh from its toothless mouth.<br><br>\u201cYou should\u2019ve handed over the Plate while you had the chance, Hoister. Your muscles are no match for steel.\u201d the figure said lowly.<br><br>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Natty said, smugly, \u201cThink again, asshole. [Pump]!\u201d",

Here are some issues I have:<br><br>1. Natty, as of his introduction in chapter 2, is way too buff, way too soon. We have only ever seen him kill insignificant mooks, and his pump ability needs a downside. I propose this:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make what you just made be chapter 3 be chapter 3 or 4</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make chapter 2 (and possibly 3) be about him surviving in the woods or sth similar, and getting his ass beaten into the ground</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have some mentor figure teach him how to fend for himself</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;End the chapter with him performing a brutal fatality on something like a bear or a yeti</span><br><br>Then , write a short paragraph detailing the guard&#039;s duty, before adding more or less what you wrote.<br><br>2. As for [pump], it needs a drawback of some kind. I suggest that it increases muscle size by something like 1.2x or 1.5x to remain anatomically reasonable (2x or 2.5x should be proper for a villain, though), and that it works by forcing his body to exert his muscles to their maximum capacity. In this state, he can easily break bones and cause himself organ damage (due to sheer muscle swelling and overexertion), and, as of now, make pump only usable for a couple of seconds.<br><br>And I realize that you&#039;re trying to set up a mystery as for what Nat&#039;s up to, but honestly, it falls flat because the reader has literally nothing to go on.<br><br>As for villains, I suggest theming the major ones after the 7 deadly sins (lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, pride), with each one putting an aspect of Nat&#039;s personality to the test. I suggest the first one be Lust, and perhaps could be related to that one catgirl you introduced in some manner.<br><br>But, as I said, move this chapter forward a bit, and give us something perhaps directly after his grandmother&#039;s (or village&#039;s) death. That&#039;s a good reason to age him up to 15 from the very beginning.",
