Closing in behind her were a group of rabid Coomans, howling and retching, clawing at the air.<br><br>\u201cHurrghh\u2026 A girl\u2026 Hhheerrr\u2026 Girl\u2026 Aaaaaaa! I AM GONNA\u2026 I AM GONNA\u2026!\u201d they gargled, their bloodshot eyes flickering madly in the light of the burning houses. They sprinted, flailing their limbs, possessed.<br><br>\u201cNo!! Stay away from me!\u201d she yelled, turning to run into a side street. She looked around desperately for a place to hide, ducking into a shallow cellar dug into the foundation of a house. She clutched her hands against her mouth as she heard the group of raving maniacs run past her hiding spot. Holding her breath for what felt like an eternity, she confirmed that she couldn\u2019t hear anyone outside before daring to stick her head out. Climbing out, she checked behind her before setting off in a direction heading out of the village, only to run straight into the back of a Cooman. She fell to the ground.<br><br>The Cooman turned around and stared at her. In the blink of an eye, he was on her, throbbing and grinding up against her frame.<br><br>\u201cGET OFF ME, AAAAH!\u201d she yelled, but the Cooman had her pinned down. He leaned down and licked her dirt-covered face.<br><br>\u201cHaaaah, girllll\u2026 A real, human girl\u2026 AAAAHH, I AM GONNA\u2026 GONNA..!!\u201d the Cooman spat in her face.<br><br>\u201cNOOOO!!\u201d Fayn cried out. The cold night didn\u2019t answer.",

She was drenched in cold sweat, gasping for air, her heart beating its way out of her chest. Looking around, she found she was still in her chamber where she\u2019d fallen asleep, far away from the village where she had used to live. Far away from them.<br><br>\u201cThe same nightmare again...\u201d She held a hand to her chest, trying to calm down her heartbeat. She took a few deep breaths before getting up to get dressed. As she finished strapping herself into her leather harness, someone knocked on her door.<br><br>\u201cRose. You\u2019re up.\u201d A voice said from the outside.<br><br>Fayn tied her short-cropped hair into a ponytail with a blue ribbon hanging from a hook on the wall, grabbed an apple from the bowl of fresh fruit left on a table near the door and headed out into a torchlit hallway. Eating the apple as she walked, she went down the maze of corridors, a deep rumbling sound in the distance growing louder and louder. She turned a corner and was greeted respectfully by an entourage of people waiting for her before a large metal gate. The rumbling noise had grown into a full-on roar. She handed the apple core to one of the retainers who bowed his head before her, and stepped past the gate and out onto the ground floor of a massive amphitheater. Bonfires along the top of the walls lit up the area, massive drums beating a war-like rhythm, and the rows were packed full with spectators, all chanting to the rhythm of the beat.<br><br>\u201cROSE! ROSE! ROSE! ROSE!\u201d they went, increasing in excitement as they spotted her entering the ring.",

In the opposite end of the ring, a metal gate opened up, and her opponent stepped out into the ring. They both walked towards the middle until they stood face-to-face with each other. The one she was about to fight was a man at least two heads taller than her, and twice as wide. He was bald, barefoot, and apart from a pair of cloth trousers, the only thing he wore was a dark, metal-studded mask covering most of his face. Fayn gave him a look up and down his body.<br><br>\u201cYup,\u201d she said casually, \u201cyou\u2019re definitely a big guy, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d<br><br>The large man laughed harshly.<br><br>\u201cFor you, little girl.\u201d He retorted mockingly.<br><br>Fayn clicked her tongue in disappointment.

The crowd and drums quieted down immediately, almost as if on cue.<br><br>A slender man dressed in long, colorful robes stood up from a decorative chair on the podium, looked over the crowd, and raised his hands in a salute. He drew his breath, and let his magically enhanced voice boom out over the arena.<br><br>\u201cHonorable members of the public, welcome, to this evening\u2019s final battle that we have all been waiting for. At the left gate, we have our reigning master, the Champion of Ringstad here to defend her title, The Unforgiving, Blue Rose!\u201d<br><br>The crowd went wild again, cheering and yelling. Fayn waved and smiled at the rows in acknowledgment. A few roses fell down into the ring, thrown by dedicated fans. The announcer raised his hands to quiet down the crowd before continuing.",

Even though Aniki was a [Bard], he couldn\u2019t play any instruments, but he was damn good at whistling. Natty scratched his head, running a hand over his newly buzzed hair, and adjusted his shirt collar. Aniki had insisted on getting him to a hairdresser and tailor first thing in the morning to get rid of his literal caveman beard and mane, and get him a fresh set of civilized clothes, \u2018to bring out your rugged handsomeness, and also make it more difficult for those freaks to recognize you\u2019 he\u2019d said with a wink. Natty pocketed his Adventurer\u2019s ID, and followed Aniki, who were heading towards the center of Ringstad.<br><br>Before long, they were standing in front of a massive structure several stories high. Huge pillars of white, polished stone ran along its outer walls, holding up the gigantic stone bricks used to form the core of the construction. The building curved along it\u2019s length, and didn\u2019t seem to have any discernible corners. Arced entryways were scattered evenly along the ground floor, and people could be seen coming and going in a steady stream from all directions. From a quick glance, it seemed to take up the space of several farm fields.<br><br>Natty marveled at the sheer scale of the place. Aniki took a few steps forward and turned around.<br><br>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Aniki said with a sly smile, spreading out his arms, \u201cTo the Ring.\u201d<br><br>-<br><br>\u201cRingstad was originally founded by soldiers who had set up camp here at the coast, waiting for a war that never came.\u201d Aniki explained, as they walked along the walls of the Ring. \u201cTo pass the time, they would host mock battles, especially unarmed brawls, and bet on them. Rumors spread about the place, and eventually drew in people from near and far who wished to test their strength against strong opponents. Many stayed behind, and over the centuries the city grew to what it is now. Ah, this is our entry.\u201d",

Natty followed him. Inside was a spacious lobby, walls cut from the same type of stone as outside. A few tables and benches were placed along the walls, and a clerical station was seated before a hallway leading further into the structure. A bored looking, frumpy, middle-aged woman was sitting at the station. Aniki strolled up to her.<br><br>\u201cGood morning, Susan. You look as beautiful as ever!\u201d Aniki chirped.<br><br>\u201cFuck off, Billy.\u201d She droned back. Her eyes went from the parchments she was reading to Natty, and gave him a stony look. \u201cIt\u2019s 50 ren for a single entry, 1000 ren for a month\u2019s entry, and free entry if you\u2019re a Ring Battler.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI guess a single entry?\u201d Natty said, looking to Aniki. Aniki nodded. Natty handed over 5 bronze coins and followed Aniki further in. \u201cYou don\u2019t pay?\u201d He asked Aniki.<br><br>\u201cGold Membership, baby.\u201d Aniki said, pulling out a brass card from his inner pocket. \u201cI pay a year in advance. Any [Bard] worth his salt would. This place has everything I need; even if I got kicked out on the street, I could bathe and launder clothes here. Besides, when I\u2019m not guiding tourists, I\u2019m always here training and\u2026 Making connections.\u201d Aniki turned his head as a well-built young man walked past them, gazing at his bottom along the way.<br><br>\u201cI am suddenly incredibly uncomfortable.\u201d Natty remarked.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry!\u201d Aniki laughed, \u201cThe Gym is for everyone. Just like I am.\u201d He winked.<br><br>From the hallway, they entered into a room. Light was streaming in from narrow windows along the ceiling. There was a few benches in the middle of the room, and the walls were lined with shelves containing numbered baskets.",

He was suddenly stark naked. \u201cOnly women wear clothes in the Gymnasium. Real men train in the nude.\u201d<br><br>-<br><br>The Gymnasium consisted of a long, rectangular, open field, surrounded by pillared structural walls. In the field itself were several rings marked by posts, rope tied between them, where men were wrestling against each other in sparring matches. Stone slabs in different shapes and angles were positioned in the field as well, with racks of differently-sized half-moon shaped stones with handles carved into them located nearby, people using them in conjunction with the benches to work different muscle groups. Wooden poles of different heights with metal bars mounted on them were also prevalent, and people were practicing all types of acrobatics on them. Along the edge of the field were a running track, and several athletes were doing rounds on it.<br><br>A massive lizardman waltzed past Natty and Aniki, making the ground shake and almost knocking Natty to the floor with its tail. Aniki was standing with his hands to his sides, smiling at the whole scene. He drew a deep breath.<br><br>\u201cIsn\u2019t it fantastic!?\u201d he beamed, \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate display of raw masculinity!\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t know, bro.\u201d Natty said, dodging a cursing runner as he entered the field along with Aniki. \u201cBut I guess this place is as good as it gets.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018as good as it gets?\u2019\u201d Aniki said, pretending to be hurt. \u201cThis place is state-of-the-art!

It was heavy and felt coarse to the touch, but it had a good balance. He curled it a few times to get a feel for it.<br><br>\u201cYeah, these will work just fine.\u201d Natty smiled. Putting the weight back on the rack, he looked up and scouted along the walls, spotting a figure near one of the drinking fountains built into the foundation. He froze on the spot, his eyes fixated. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. <br><br>\u201cOh,\u201d Aniki remarked casually, after tracing Natty\u2019s line of sight, \u201cIt\u2019s the Ringstad Champion.\u201d<br><br>Drinking deeply from a clay amphora was a young, slender woman, wearing a pair of short cloth shorts and a light leather brassiere. Her flawless skin was tan, with white lines alluding to where her usual clothes would block out the sun. Her toned musculature shone in the morning sun, sweat and water dripping off her, droplets from the amphora trickling down her chest, caressing the structure of her perfect abs, before continuing down her thick thighs. She poured the remaining water from the amphora onto her short, frizzy hair, and stretched herself, curving her firm back like a cat. She shot a quick gaze over at Natty and Aniki.<br><br>Natty had to drop down on the spot and start doing push-ups, as to not embarrass himself.<br><br>\u201cHe-ey, that\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Aniki complimented, and went over to grab a pair of stone weights.<br><br>-<br><br>\u201cAhhh, that\u2019s the stuff,\u201d Natty sighed, sinking himself into the hot water. \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s a warm bath here.

They were both lounging in a large, steaming bath cut into the stone floor in one of the side rooms of the Gymnasium. Natty\u2019s entire body relaxed, having had one of the best workouts of his life. They both meditated in silence for a few minutes, soaking in the relaxation.<br><br>\u201cSay,\u201d Natty started, \u201cThat woman earlier, the \u2018Ringstad Champion\u2019. Who is she?\u201d<br><br>\u201cShe\u2019s the reigning master of the Ring, known as \u2018Blue Rose\u2019. Undefeated for over a year. Appeared suddenly out of nowhere, and schooled everyone. People say she\u2019s blessed by the Gods with the way she fights. No one seems to be able to force her to submission.\u201d Aniki leaned back, sinking deeper into the water. \u201cWhy, you fancy her?\u201d he said, jokingly.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Natty said, happy that the heat had already flushed his face, \u201cI\u2019m just curious. It\u2019s rare to see a woman like her in a place like this.\u201d<br><br>\u201cShe\u2019s here every day.

Why, you plan to take on the Champion?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI think I might have to.\u201d Natty said with a slight smile, before sinking his head all the way under the water.<br><br>- - - - -<br><br>And that&#039;s it for chapter 3.
